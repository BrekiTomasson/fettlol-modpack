There are 2 different presets, one is the default for this datapack and the other is a less extreme terrain version, 
the less extreme is good for certain seeds that already have extreme terrain as the default one would stretch the terrain too much and cause too many shattered pieces of land 

There are 2 new presets inside TREES CONFIGURATION, One has no custom trees and has similar terrain to the default preset.

The other one has less custom trees, looking more like vanilla while still being able to frequently see the new custom trees
